# Segmentation of an e-commerce platform's customer database

 The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).
 It contains various data on the sellers, buyers (customers) and products sold on the Brazilian e-commerce platform Olist.
 
 The goal of this project is to use Unsupervised Machine Learning to segment the customers in clusters usable/interpretable by a CRM team. 
 
 **The final model (Kmeans) is trained on features of a standard "RFM" segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value of a customer and its orders) and the average review score left by the customer.**
